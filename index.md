## As a programmer
I am proficient in **Java** and **C++**, but I also know other programming languages such as **Python** and **HTML**. Since I am preparing for applying Summer Internships and interviews, I have been doing [LeetCodes](https://leetcode.com/) when I have the time. However, so far I have only done around *60* questions. I always remember these words before doing programming assignments.
>Start Early, Start Often!

In UCSD, I will replace the typical "Hello World" with printing these words out. In **Java** it will be:

 `System.out.println("Start Early, Start Often!")`

## As a person
My hobbies are playing golf and skiing/snowboarding (when there is snow!). Here is a [picture](pics/IMG_3334.jpg) of the place I went snowboarding. I also love going roadships during holidays. The states that I have visited so far are:
- California
- Nevada
- Utah
- Arizona

I will be ranking the national parks that I have visited so far:
1. Death Valley National Park
2. Bryce Canyon National Park
3. Grand Canyon National Park
4. Sequoia National Park
5. Yosemite National Park
6. Capitol Reef National Park
7. Joshua Tree National Park

Here are my **goals** that I want to achieve by the end of this year:
- [ ] Secure a Summer internship this year
- [ ] Being able to record myself snowboarding without falling
- [ ] Improve my golf skills
- [x] Sleep early!
